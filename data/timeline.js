    duration: '2 years',
    details: 'My work at Groupon had been largely frontend-focused, so I accepted a role at Capital One with a data engineering team to experience another side of the stack. We used AWS services and in-house tools to build 25+ data pipelines (there were so many, I honestly lost count). We used these to receive data from an outside vendor and transform it so our internal teams could balance our ledger, run fraud checks, and meet regulatory requirements. It was another crash course, but this time I had to learn data engineering and governance, finance, and compliance. I also learned Python and Javascript, and used SQL on the job.',

    duration: '2 years',
    details: 'The two years I spent in product at Groupon was a crash course in the fundamentals. I put Agile principles in my coffee and Scrum in my afternoon tea. I ate data for lunch with a side of SQL to provide solid business cases for each new feature we built. I served up A/B testing to make sure our decisions were driving by data. And in the end, I managed to pull off a platform migration and increase the visibility of our deals by incorporating them into the main Groupon marketplace.',

    duration: '1 year',
    details: 'The Coupons channel was brand new and we had little to no tooling, so I jumped in with the engineers to identify requirements for a content management system. Eventually, I started taking on more and more complex projects. I used process mapping to identify inefficiencies in our workflows and worked with our engineering team to implement solutions to our problems. One day my manager said, "You\'re not a project manager, you\'re a product manager." Not long after, packed up my desk and sat down next to my engineering team. (Side note: remember when we all went to the office everyday and had desks? That was wild.)',

    details: "I kicked off my career at Groupon as a writer. Back then, jokes were king, and I was tasked with incorporating humor into our deal copy. While writing thousands of deal descriptions, I realized we needed to get more bang for our buck out of all this content. I studied SEO to see if search engines could help ramp up the visibility of our carefully crafted prose. This research soon became a course that earned me a rep as an SEO subject-matter expert. It's also one of many moves that landed me a role on a new affiliate-marketing channel, now known as Groupon Coupons.",
